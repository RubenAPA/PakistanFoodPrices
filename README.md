# PakistanFoodPrices
EDA and automated report from Kaggle database called "Pakistan - Food Prices".
The project was carried out for the course called "Introduction to R applied to agroindustry: Focus on process automation", for this reason not all the data have been analyzed. More analyzes will be carried out soon, to make it more complete.

For the analysis carried out in the report, I use a variety of graphs like: Boxplot, Density chart, line plot and contingency tables.
